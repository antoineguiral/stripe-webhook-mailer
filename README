Webhook-Mailer: A simple example of using Stripe webhooks
---------------------------------------------------------

This example was built on heroku, but should be easily deployable in any
environment that can support Ruby and rack.

The app sends an email anytime an invoice.payment_succeeded Stripe event 
webhook is received. 

To deploy on heroku:

1. Create a new heroku app
	heroku create <APP_NAME>

2. Add the mailgun add-on 
	heroku addons:add mailgun:starter

3. Add your stripe api key to your heroku config environment
	https://manage.stripe.com/#account/apikeys
	heroku config:add STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_KEY>

4. Add your webhook url to your stripe dashboard
	https://manage.stripe.com/#account/webhooks

5. Customize your email body
6. Deploy your app to heroku!
